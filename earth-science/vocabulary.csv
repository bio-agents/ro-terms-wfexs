Data Cube Collection;Class;Data Cube Collection;A set of Data Cube Products sharing a common specification or characteristics. For example a series of Data Cube products from the same satellite (e.g. MSG) and the same sensor (detector, e.g. SEVIRI/optical) at different times (adapted from OGC OpenSearch Earth Observation extension).
Data Cube Product;Class;Data Cube Product;An identifiable collection of data under one single identifier. It is independent of a physical form or an encoding even if it is normally distributed in a single file (adapted from OGC OpenSearch Earth Observation extension).
Executable Research Object;Class;Executable Research Object;An executable research object is a research object that aggregates at least one artifact of executable type, e.g., python script, Jupyter Notebook, R script or any other code or software artifact. It might of course aggregates any other kind of resources.
Jupyter Notebook;Class;Jupyter Notebook;Document produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc). Notebook are both human-readable documents as well as executable documents.
